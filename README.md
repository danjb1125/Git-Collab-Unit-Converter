# Git-Collab-Unit-Converter
This activity is about using git collaboration. Here, we made a simple unit converter in java that converts meters to kilometers to test the git collab.

Git-Collab-Unit-Converter is made by the following students from BSCS-2B:

1. Dan Jheniel Bringas (danjb1125) - Leader/Owner of the Repository. He is tasked to manage and check the incoming request, such as pushing, pulling, and merging changes or merging branches.
2. Jevon Castro (Hachishib) - Collaborator/Partner. He is tasked on updating and changing the features and adding some functionality to the project. He also makes the documentation for the project
